# Tactical Patterns

### Lower-Level Architecture / Implementation
##### (Executive Branch)

- Aggregates
- Entities
- Value Objects
- Repositories
- CQRS
- Event Sourcing

# Ubiquitous Language

> So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth. -Genesis 11:8-9

# Strategic Patterns

### Top-Level Architecture
##### (Legislative Branch)

Top-Level Architecture

- Bounded Contexts
- Subdomains
- Core Domain
- Domain Events

# Implementing Domain Driven Design

##### (Don't take this literally and actually create these classes in your system)

```C#
public interface IDomainDrivenDesign { }

public abstract class ServiceOrientedArchitecture : IDomainDrivenDesign { }
public abstract class MicroServices : ServiceOrientedArchitecture { }

public class YourSystem : ServiceOrientedArchitecture
{
  private YourCoreDomain _coreDomain;
  private YourSupportingSubdomain0 _subdomain0;
  private YourSupportingSubdomain1 _subdomain1;
  // ...
}

public class YourCoreDomain : EventSourcing { }
public class YourSupportingSubdomain0 : JustCRUD { }
```

# Key Benefits of Strategic Domain-Driven Design

- Work with Conway's Law rather than against it
- Autonomy
- Tackle smaller problems and compose larger solutions
